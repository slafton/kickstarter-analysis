#Kickstarting with Excel
##Overview of Project: I used formulas to provided needed data to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
###The purpose of this so that Louise could see how other campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
##Analysis and Challenges
###Analysis of Oucomes based on Launch Date. In our Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date table we can see that the best months to launch a campaing were from Jan. to Jul. After that they go down but there was a rise in Oct and Nov. 
###Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals. In our Outcomes Based on Goal table and chart we can see that the most successful were those with goals up to $4,999, and $35,000to $44999. $5000 to $19999 were in the 50 percent range. 
###One of the challenges I faced with created the first pivot table was a few of my numbers were slightly off. I had to restart by downloading the Kickstarter file again and then my numbers were good. Moving onto the Outcomes Based on Goals I needed a little help understand the COUNTIFS function. Once I understood the function and how to type it I was able to easily fill in the table and make my line chart. 
##Results. 
###Conclusion 1: The first half of the year is a better time to launch a campaign than the second half of the year.
###Conclusion 2: If launching a campaign during the second half of the year, launch in Oct or Nov.
###Limitations could be that this data is a little old. It looks like the latest year was 2017. If you were looking to launch a campaing next year I think it would be worthwhile to get more updated date and rerun some of the numbers. 
###Another possible graph could be one showing the success/failures with the number of backers. How popular a theme is and whether the public has an interest in it would certainly play a role in a successful campaign.
